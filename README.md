# AdvDiffuer
This is an unofficial implement, where most code are copied from https://github.com/ChicForX/advdiff_impl. I do some changes:
- The Grad-CAM in Paper "AdvDiffuser: Natural Adversarial Example Synthesis with Diffusion Models" is generated from the classifier that we want to attack. But in the origin repo, the author trained another classifier on noise instead of clean data, which leads the mask generated becoming heatmaps of noise. However, we expect the heatmap is graph whose shape is like the correct label, instead of noise, so that we can get more natural information.
- So I mainily changed the `AdvDiffuer.py` and tried several 'timesteps' to train the DDPM. However, I didn't find a good timesteps that generate high quality images. Maybe we should change the DDPM in `diffusionNet.py` to more rubust model such as classifier guidance DDPM. This is to-do stuff.
